# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch 🤖📚

This repository contains (will contain) various machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy (mostly). The aim is to understand the fundamentals of each algorithm by building them step-by-step, without relying on pre-built libraries.

### Algorithms Implemented 👨🏻‍💻:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Linear Regression
